# Handwritten-Character-Classification

Handwritten Character Classifier of Handwritten letters A-Z, implemented using the SciKit-learn library in Python.

The voting classifier was trained on 100 000 samples, using the A_Z Handwritten Data.csv file I found on kaggle, achieving an accuracy of just under 97%.
